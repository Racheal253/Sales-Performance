# Sales-Performance


## Project Overview 

This project aims to deliver insights into sales performance for MavenTech Company across various teams. The analysis focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, win rates, and sales trends over time. Data from different teams were consolidated and visualized using Power BI to provide a comprehensive view of each team's contribution to the company's overall performance. The project incorporates interactive elements such as buttons for easy navigation between reports, card visuals with reference labels for quick summaries, and up/down arrows to signal growth or decline in sales.

The project also includes in-depth DAX measures to analyze sales performance by individual team members, allowing sales managers to identify areas of improvement and make informed decisions.
